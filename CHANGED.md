# Changes

## 5.4.0

### Dynamic Haptics (Apple-style)

- Vibration amplitude now tracks the music's actual energy in real-time
- Quiet passages produce gentle vibrations, loud passages produce strong ones
- Dynamic range restored: peak amplitude varies from 5 to 255 instead of always 255
- Duration scales with beat intensity: strong beats slightly longer, weak beats shorter and crisper
- Envelope sustain is intensity-dependent: punchy for strong hits, smooth for gentle ones

### Fixes

- Fixed amplitude crushing: level was always clamped to 1.90, peak always 255, making every beat feel identical regardless of music energy
- Fixed double-fire on StrikeOnly devices (AW8697): native direct-drive and Kotlin Waveform were both firing for each beat, causing a double-tap. Now only the Kotlin shaped-envelope path fires
- Fixed fixed 33ms duration: duration now scales with intensity (6-80ms range)
- Fixed native intensity mapping: onset values were multiplied by fixed per-event constants (255/220/170/150), now use dynamic onset strength directly

### Continuous Texture

- Added RMS-based texture pulsing for StrikeOnly devices
- Pulses at ~50Hz with amplitude proportional to the audio's band energy
- Creates perceived sustained texture similar to Apple Music Haptics "textures"

### UI / Settings

- Master switch now properly stops the native scheduler and all haptic output
- UI settings (amplitude, bass boost, preset, style) now have real effect on output
- Added foreground service for background keepalive with a persistent notification

## 5.3.2

- Removed the root onboarding screen.
- Removed unused music-analysis, legacy haptic and health-monitor code.
- Unified global and per-app runtime settings.
- Fixed PCM16 decoding and stale-frame handling.
- Advanced synthesizer parameters applied to live output.
- Preserved envelope timing on fallback devices.
- Raised default haptic output.
- Removed unused dependencies and dead code.
